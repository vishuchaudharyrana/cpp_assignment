#  C++ Assignment Tasks Overview

This repository includes 11 C++ programs designed to build core programming concepts and modern C++ (C++17) practices including data structures, algorithms, concurrency, smart pointers, and numerical methods.

Each file is self-contained and prints results to the console. These programs are educational and demonstrate real-world problem-solving patterns.

Task15.cpp
This C++ program performs basic statistical analysis on a dataset using the Standard Template Library (<vector>, <algorithm>, <numeric>, and <cmath>). It includes the implementation of functions to calculate:

Mean: The average value of the dataset.

Median: The middle value when the dataset is sorted.

Variance: A measure of data spread around the mean.

Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance, representing data dispersion.

Example Dataset:
cpp
Copy
Edit
std::vector<double> dataset = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0};
Sample Output:
yaml
Copy
Edit
Mean: 3  
Median: 3  
Variance: 2  
Standard Deviation: 1.41421
This is a simple and modular program useful for statistical computation and data analysis demonstrations in C++.
